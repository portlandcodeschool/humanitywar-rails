  %h1 About Us
  %p This project was an in-class teaching project worked on by everyone in session #2 of the Portland Code School. The core idea was proposed by @neilmakn and built on by the whole class. We really thought it was going to be a proper student project but the content was judged too... questionable, to be used as a portfolio project.
  %p But we still wanted to do it, so there you are.
  %p If you are learning Rails, please feel free to use this project as a base.
